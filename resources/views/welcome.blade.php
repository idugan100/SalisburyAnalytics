            <p>This site is a forum for course and professor information that is focused on postive and informative feedback. Many educational review sites 
                are filled with rants that are unhelpful and often baseless. By partnering directly with universities we can provide the most accurate, extensive
                and constuctive educational review site. if you fill out the below form, we'll make sure your review fits with our vision and make it public!

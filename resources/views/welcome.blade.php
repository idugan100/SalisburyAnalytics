            <p>This site is a forum for course and professor information that is focused on postive and informative feedback. Many educational review sites 
                are filled with rants that are unhelpful and often baseless. By partnering directly with universities we can provide the most accurate, extensive
                and constuctive educational review site.
            </p>
            <p>As or right now, there is a school policy that forbids the public access of any staff evaluation information.
                If you'd like this site to be fully functional, please contact the SGA, SU senate or a department chair.

                This site is specifically for Salisbury Univeristy. If you would be interested in this service at your school let us know and we'll get to work!
